****
Think about putting in users screen for admin only
users.php, some html
Therefore, add the table of users. Where does it go??? It will all be in mySQL


In database will need to certainly have a number of tables
users table.
Then the main database. But the users table is in the same database as the main database.
Need to create users and password with md3/5 (look up what it is basically password encryption for online deployment). Plus roles

****
Film or music database???
use csv to mysql

need specific pages and files. Maybe, it will just be one page and it is controlled from PHP???

certainly, you need
1 login screen
3 view screens, 1 for each of the admin permission rights: admin, authorised users (called contributors), guests (subscribers?).

then later but soon, model out the files and folders needed.
Even if skeletal and populate with stuff you already know / have, like logger, notices, etc.
